My own practice for threading, processing and other concurrent library

## Multithreading

Demo code to figure out some threading object designed concept

### Some point of view for using multithreading

- Multithreading within the process share the same data space with main thread
- Less memory overhead than processes
- There's two different kind of thread
  - kernel thread: part of operating system
  - user thread: not implement in kernel
